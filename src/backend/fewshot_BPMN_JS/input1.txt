Rules:
1. bpmn:participant has each @processRef as a swimlane
2. bpmn:messageFlow must connect one swimlane to another swimlane by task or event as @sourceRef and @targetRef (every task or event in the different swimlane must be connected by bpmn:messageFlow)
3. bpmn:sequenceFlow only connect tasks or events in a swimlane as @sourceRef and @targetRef (every task or event in the same swimlane must be connected by bpmn:sequenceFlow)
4. Each bpmn:task must have bpmn:sequenceFlow or bpmn:messageFlow element at least once as source and once as target.
5. output can only have one bpmn:startEvent as the opening BPMN and one bpmn:endEvent as the closing BPMN

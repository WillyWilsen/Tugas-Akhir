In 2021, a complex legal case occurred involving several parties. The construction company "Maju Bangun" pretended to practice corruption and bribery in obtaining highway construction projects in certain areas. This process began when the director of the "Maju Bangun" project, Budi Santoso, persuaded a government official, Andi Wijaya, to provide a certain amount of money to give the project to their company. Andi Wijaya, as the decision-making official, accepted bribes from Budi Santoso and ensured that "Maju Bangun" won the project contract. The bribe money was channeled through an intermediary, Linda Setiawan, a businessman who has connections with the parties involved. Linda Setiawan, as her partner, distributed the bribe money to several secret accounts and made transfers to several fake companies to support the trail. When the highway construction project began, it was revealed that the construction materials used by "Maju Bangun" did not comply with the standards regulated by the government.

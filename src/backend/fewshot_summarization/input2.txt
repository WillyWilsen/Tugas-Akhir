In 2021, a complex legal case occurred involving several parties. The construction company "Maju Bangun" pretended to practice corruption and bribery in obtaining highway construction projects in certain areas. This process began when the director of the "Maju Bangun" project, Budi Santoso, persuaded a government official, Andi Wijaya, to provide a certain amount of money to give the project to their company. Andi Wijaya, as the decision-making official, accepted bribes from Budi Santoso and ensured that "Maju Bangun" won the project contract. The bribe money was channeled through an intermediary, Linda Setiawan, a businessman who has connections with the parties involved. Linda Setiawan, as her partner, distributed the bribe money to several secret accounts and made transfers to several fake companies to support the trail. When the highway construction project began, it was revealed that the construction materials used by "Maju Bangun" did not comply with the standards regulated by the government. A project inspector, Dian Prasetyo, discovered the discrepancy and tried to submit a report to the supervisory agency. However, Dian Prasetyo experienced pressure from internal parties at "Maju Bangun" to remain silent and accept bribes so as not to report his findings. The legal process began when a whistleblower, Rini Susanti, who worked in the finance department of "Maju Bangun", felt uncomfortable with the corrupt practices occurring at the company. Rini Susanti decided to report this case to the Corruption Eradication Commission and provide evidence that strengthens her claims.

Summarize the action process model performed by the subject without opening and closing statements from the following document!

A leading technology company, InnovateTech, discovered that some of their former employees were leaking company secrets and planning to start a new company that competes unfairly. This action involved several individuals, including the new CEO of a rival company, an engineer who had access to product planning, and a financial analyst who devised a marketing strategy. The story begins when a rival company's new CEO, Alex Miller, recruits a senior engineer, Laura Davis, and a financial analyst, Michael Turner, from InnovateTech. They bring confidential information about unreleased products, business plans, and marketing strategies. Next, they founded a new company, TechInnovate, which openly copied InnovateTech's innovations and products. InnovateTech felt aggrieved and filed a lawsuit against TechInnovate, Alex Miller, Laura Davis, and Michael Turner for intellectual property theft, breach of contract, and unfair business competition. The legal process involves lawyers from both parties, InnovateTech's internal legal team, and the court as the party that determines the fate of the case. If TechInnovate is found guilty, TechInnovate will be punished for intellectual property theft.

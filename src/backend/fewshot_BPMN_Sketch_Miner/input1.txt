Create a BPMN in the following format!

BPMN Syntax Rules:
1. One Line One Element: Every element of the diagram corresponds to a line of your text.
2. First Word is the Element Type: To refine elements, specify their type at the beginning of their line.
3. Each Element Once: The same element (task or event) only appears once in the visual model, even if it may be repeated in multiple sequences of your text.
4. Events are in ( ).
5. Data objects are in [ ].
6. Pool is a subject that performs actions.

BPMN Element Mapping:
Character => BPMN Element
:         => Pool (Pools visually describe the independent actors and subjects participating in the collaboration. They capture who is involved in the processes and who is in charge of executing each task.)
?         => Exclusive Gateway Labels (At a more precise level of details, exclusive gateways may be refined to describe under which conditions their outgoing paths may be taken.)
|         => Parallel Gateways (Parallel branches indicate where multiple tasks can be concurrently executed.)
()        => Events (While tasks represent what needs to be done to achieve the goal of a process, events describe asynchronous interactions between the process and the external world.)
[]        => Data (Data objects represent the input or output of activities.)
//        => Text Annotations (You can draw text annotation by prefixing them with two slashes //.)
///       => Comments (If you use instead three slashes (///) you will be commenting out the line of your text. Commented out lines are ignored by BPMN Sketch Miner and do not affect the diagram.)
...       => Fragments (Fragments are used to list incomplete task sequences which should be attached to other task sequences. Use fragments to avoid repeating too many lines in your text.)

Output Rules:
1. Output must have only 1 (start Start)
2. Output must be ended by (finish End)
